**Vue** is a Javascript framework developed by Evan You in 2014. Year after year, the Vue.js community grow and it became one of the most used Javascript framework. 

Having used **React** for a long time, I decided that it was time to try something else. My choice falls on Vue.js, as it was a framework I didn't know yet (unlike **Angular**), in a short time I fell in love and supplanted my choice to use React within my projects.

After several months of use, I decided to pick up again this repository (which I created in January 2019) to complete it and add further examples.
